# We create a shell to manage our AirBnB objects.

This is the first step in creating our first full web application: the ``AirBnB clone``

## What’s a command interpreter (shell)?

It is a program that receives commands from a user,
our console has the following functions:

``create``  ``update`` ``Destroy``  ``store`` ``persists``  -> Objects

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object

# Starting

### 1 - Install python

````
sudo apt install python3.8

````
git clone https://github.com/sanei1509/holbertonschool-AirBnB_clone.git
````

### 3 - Execute the console
````
./console.py
````

you should see the following prompt waiting for your commands
````
(hbnb)
````

## Non interactive mode

````
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
